# everglades-multitask

A Claude Code skill that lets Project Everglades experts construct, calibrate, and ship 3–5 inverse or forward scientific reasoning tasks in parallel — driven entirely from Claude Code, with the real Taiga 16-model eval as the final destination.

**What it gives you:**

- **Workflow A** — start with N distinct ideas, scaffold N drafts in parallel, batch preview, batch push to RLS, batch dispatch Taiga
- **Workflow B** — start with one idea, expand to 2–3 orthogonal siblings with a degeneracy check
- **Workflow C** — N tasks back from review; aggregate feedback, detect cross-task patterns, batch resubmit
- **Preview eval** — Opus 4.7 × 8 attempts via Anthropic API + tool-use, runs against your local `oracle.py`. ~$3 vs ~$10 for real Taiga, 90s vs 40 min
- **Opinionated state machine** — every draft has a `STATE.md`; skill won't let you skip a Playbook step
- **Lint** — leak-checker for `problem.md` (method names, canonical targets, strategy hints) and `oracle.py` (judgment-style modes, missing budget)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohitganti-hue/everglades-multitask.git ~/.claude/skills/everglades-multitask
cd ~/.claude/skills/everglades-multitask
pip install anthropic numpy
python3 scripts/setup.py    # first-run wizard
```

Then in Claude Code:

```
/everglades-status
```

That's it. The skill auto-loads on Everglades-related prompts.

## Quickstart — Workflow A

```
> /everglades-ideate 3

Skill: Paste your 3 briefs (one per line).

You:
  1) EG-1, ATAC-seq, ALS iPSC subtype-specific signal vs covariates
  2) EG-7, PK 2-compartment inverse, recover V1, V2, k10, k12, k21
  3) EG-1, RNA velocity inverse, colorectal cancer reversion candidate

Skill: scaffolds 3 drafts at ~/everglades-drafts/{2026-05-28-atac, ...},
       walks Playbook Steps 1-4 across all 3 round-robin.

After ~25 min, all 3 drafts SCAFFOLDED.

> /everglades-preview-batch

  ATAC-seq:        2/8 ✓ IN RANGE
  PK 2-comp:       5/8 ✗ TOO EASY · urine mode leaks k10
  RNA velocity:    0/8 ✗ check main.py · 6/8 errored on tool call

Iterate the weak ones. Re-preview. Then:

> /everglades-push-all
> /everglades-eval-all
# (Taiga 16-model runs dispatched in parallel; ~50 min wall-clock)

> /everglades-submit task-a task-b
```

3 tasks shipped in one session.

## Config

The skill stores credentials in `~/.everglades/config.json` (mode 600):

```json
{
  "rls_api_key": "rls-sk-...",
  "anthropic_api_key": "sk-ant-...",
  "domain_code": "EG-1",
  "world_id": "world_95d559681bc0411db772f38393216250",
  "expert_id": "user_...",
  "preview_model": "claude-opus-4-7",
  "preview_attempts": 8
}
```

Setup wizard prompts for each. Re-run `python3 scripts/setup.py` to update.

```

**AI Use Policy:** The skill helps scaffold Python code. The skill does NOT write your prompt, reasoning trap, grading guidance, or explanation. You own the science.

## Preview eval — how it works

The `preview` command launches N parallel Anthropic API calls (default: Opus 4.7 × 8 attempts), each with tool-use access to `query_oracle` and `submit_answer`. The `query_oracle` tool routes calls to your local `oracle.py`. The `submit_answer` tool compares to `expected.json` within tolerance.

Pass rate interpretation:

- **0/8** — check `main.py`; likely broken
- **1–2/8** — IN RANGE; dispatch to Taiga
- **3–4/8** — BORDERLINE; harden once
- **5+/8** — TOO EASY; transcript_analyzer suggests which strategy to apply

Cost: ~$3 per preview, ~90 seconds wall-clock with `--attempts 8`.

## Sahar case study

See [`examples/sahar-walkthrough.md`](examples/sahar-walkthrough.md) for a real walkthrough using Sahar E's 6 approved EG-1 bioinformatics tasks — including the duplicate task pair (`xm0vffa1` + `w49sa943`) that the degeneracy check would have caught at scaffold time.

## Status

⚠️ **v0.1 — work in progress.** Two RLS API endpoints are probed dynamically (file upload + Taiga dispatch) and may need adjustment as the RLS API surface stabilizes. The preview eval, lint, verify, and degeneracy checks are stable.
